# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/). 

One can run all tests from puzzles descriptions with PyTest, e.g.: 

```bash
pytest tests/tests.py
```

All scripts accept a file path as input:

```bash
python day1/solution1.py path/to/input.txt
```
